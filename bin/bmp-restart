=head1 SYNOPSIS

    bmp-restart
    bmp-restart check

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, this script will restart the proxy: it will look for the
pid of any currently running BMP servers, and kill them. Next, it will
start a new proxy up on localhost:8080 and then exit.

If you pass any argument in, we'll first check the status of the proxy
before restarting. If we can make a proxy, we won't do anything. If we
can't make a proxy, we will proceed as normal via killing and
restarting a new BMP process.
